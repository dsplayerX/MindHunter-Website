            Ernest Miller Hemingway was an American author and journalist. He was born on July 21, 1899 in Oak Park, 
            Illinois, where he was raised. He died on July 2, 1961 in Ketchum, Idaho, where he committed suicide.

            Hemingway's economical and understated style had a strong influence on 20th-century fiction, while his life of adventure and his public image influenced later generations. 
            Hemingway produced most of his work between the mid-1920s and the mid-1950s, and won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954. He published seven novels, six short story collections, and two non-fiction works. 
            Three novels, four collections of short stories, and three non-fiction works were published posthumously.
